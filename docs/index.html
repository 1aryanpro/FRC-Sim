        <article><h2>FRC-Sim</h2>
<p>The FRC season in 2021 was different from the previous years. I was given the opportunity to participate in the Game Design Challenge. For this we had to design a game that we could, in theory, play in a future yearâ€™s robotics competition. At one point I was tasked with balancing the game by incentivizing multiple different strategies. To do this I made a Google Sheet where a user could input and tweak different variables to see how the gameplay would react. We were able to use this to determine how we should select and adjust a few different factors in the final result, such as the distances between certain objects, and how many of the scorable objects exist on the map as well as how many points each of them should be worth. What I'm showcasing in this project is a program that I made to replace the google sheet while drastically improving it.</p>
